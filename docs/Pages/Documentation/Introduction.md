# Introduction
This section contains guides for the Locus editor and references to the C# scripting API for Locus.
It also contains an example project to demonstrate core systems of the engine. <br>
Each class reference will contain information about the class with a list of its properties and methods. <br>

Note: The documentation will be up to date with the "develop" branch, not the master branch of Locus. This means there might be documentations for classes that are not yet included in the most recent release. Each class reference will include the version number when the class was implemented to reduce confusion.
