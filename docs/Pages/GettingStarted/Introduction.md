# Introduction
This section will guide you through how to compile Locus and everything you need to know to get Locus running on your computer. <br>

## Compatibility
Locus currently only supports Windows. Integration with other operating systems will be considered if there is demand for it. 

Locus currently uses OpenGL 4.5+ for its graphics API but Vulkan and DirectX support will be integrated in the near future.

## Disclaimer
Since Locus is still a work in progress and new features are implemented frequently, save files may become corrupted.
