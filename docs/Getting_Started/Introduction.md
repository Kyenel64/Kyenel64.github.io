# Introduction
This section will guide you through how to compile Locus, and guide you through some of the engine's core features. <br>
Locus currently only supports Windows since the vast majority of users / developers use Windows. Other platform support will be considered in the future but as of right now, time and resources is limited and it does not make sense to add support for other platforms. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" target="_blank">The Steam hardware survey</a> shows ~97% of users are on Windows. 

## Disclaimer
Since Locus is still a work in progress and new features are implemented frequently, save files may also become depricated frequently. I will try and push scripts to fix save files when necessary.
