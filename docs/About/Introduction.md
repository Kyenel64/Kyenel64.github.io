# Introduction
Locus is an open-source, general-purpose 2D/3D game engine developed by Kye Nelson (<a href="https://github.com/Kyenel64" target="_blank">Kyenel64</a>). <br>
It aims to be a lightweight, feature-rich game engine capable of creating any type of game from scratch.
The engine is ECS-based and the scripting language is in C#, making it easier to learn for many game developers.

## Contribute
Since Locus is only developed by one person, progress is not fast. If you would like to contribute to the development of the engine, I am always open to receive feedback.

## About Locus
Locus initially started as a simple project for me to learn computer graphics and software architecture. 
As I spent more time on the engine, it became more mature and turned into something worth putting more time into.
I followed <a href= "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&si=-FXBvPjOmXCrR6nX" target="_blank">TheCherno's game engine series</a> to learn about game engine development and to write this engine. I strongly recommend following the series if you are also interested in game engine development.

## About Me
My name is Kye Nelson and I am a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at the University of Washington.
My focus is in computer graphics and game engine development *as you could probably tell*.
I enjoy cleaning and organizing my code just as much as writing the actual code. <br>
Outside of coding, you will likely catch me riding my road bike or listening to 80's R&B records. <br>
