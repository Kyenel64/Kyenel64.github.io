As I spent more time on the engine, it became more mature and turned into something worth putting more time into. I followed TheCherno's game engine series to learn about game engine development and to write this engine. I strongly recommend following the series if you are also interested in game engine development.</p>"},{"location":"About/Introduction/#about-me","title":"About Me","text":"<p>My name is Kye Nelson and I am a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at the University of Washington. My focus is in computer graphics and game engine development as you could probably tell. I enjoy cleaning and organizing my code just as much as writing the actual code.  Outside of coding, you will likely catch me riding my road bike or listening to 80's R&amp;B records.

I will try and push scripts to fix save files when necessary. </p>"}]}
